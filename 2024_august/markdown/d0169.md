# Summary  
Julia Fortier, a free Black woman, files a freedom suit to compel the fair valuation of Medery, who is enslaved by Antoine Joseph Picquery, and successfully purchases his liberty. This case is an example of *coartación*, a process enslaved people and their kinfolk used to force their owners to provide them with an estimate of their value so they could fund their own self-purchase.
