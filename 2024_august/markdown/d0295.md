# Summary  
[In 1726, a Bambara man named Biron arrived in Louisiana from Senegambia on the slave ship Aurora. For the next two years, he frequently resisted his enslavement. When he ran away in 1728, he was pursued by his enslaver, Jean Sougaine, who almost killed him while trying to recapture him.

Declaration  
and Complaint by  
The Sieur Soubaigne   
Against Biron, nègre  
\
[Body:]

Having appeared before the notary of the Superior Council  
of the Province of Louisiana, *Sieur* Jean Soubaigne,  
*habitant* living at Gentilly, said and declared to us  
that he has a *nègre* named Biron, obtained from  
the cargo of the ship, the Aurora, who has often gone maroon, among them yesterday at midday. He [Biron]  
was absent, and the declarant, being warned by  
his other *nègres* of this absence, he ran after [him],  
and having met him almost halfway to  
this city sitting in the canefield, and after seeing him, he [Biron] fled deep into the woods, and after  
calling him several times, [and him] not wanting to come [return]  
to him, he [Soubaigne] fired a shot at him [Biron],  
just to shock him and force him to surrender,  
which he did not want to do. On the contrary, he [Biron] ran  
again even faster. The declarant, after having made a lap around the woods, found him on the ground, and when he [Biron]  
saw him, he ran away again, and while running he  
found a reed [with his foot] that made him fall to the ground [again].  
The declarant, to prevent him from getting up,  
took aim at him and told him that if he moved again he was dead. That obliged the said *nègre*  
to return with him to the house, and while there  
the declarant called a[nother] *nègre* to put  
the maroon in irons. He [Biron] moved quickly at his [Soubaigne’s] gun [grabbing it]  
at which [time] he [Biron] made himself [his] master. The declarant,  
                                                  ~

\
holding his gun at the *nègre*, while waiting  
for help from his other *nègres*, left from him  
lest he shoot him [Biron], of whom and of what   
he [Soubaigne] makes the present declaration. [It was] done at   
New Orleans [on] July 8th, one thousand  
seven hundred twenty-eight, and signed  
\
[Signed:] [Jean] Soubaigne
