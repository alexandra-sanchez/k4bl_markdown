# Summary   
An enslaved man named Pierrot was sold to enslaver Michèl Brosset by Claude Boisson ("*tailladier en cette ville*," tool maker in this city) and his wife, Magdelaine Chenier, who had acquired Pierrot as a *piece d'inde* from the Company of the Indies[^1]. However, Pierrot went missing after having gone maroon. Boisson and Chenier promise to catch Pierrot for Brosset in exchange for cash upon delivery, which they succeed in accomplishing.

Present were Claude Boisson, tool maker  
in this city, and Magdelaine Chenier, his wife,  
who authorized for these proceedings which,     
per those present, have sold and promise  
to deliver to Sieur Michèl Brosset, resident     
in this city, a nègre pièce d’inde named       
Pierrot, guaranteed from all troubles and  
 impediments  
[to whom] against all odds [he] will belong.  
And as the aforesaid nègre has runaway, the said  
sellers oblige themselves to take him back into  
their hands  
from the said Sieur Purchaser, as soon as they will  
[have a chance to] catch him.  
The said purchaser, knowing perfectly well   
the said *nègre* and being happy as the result of  
being able to enjoy him, and the gentlemen [who  
have] known [of him] as property  
belonging to him as well as the said  
Boisson, who acquired [him] from the Company  
of the Indies,  
to whom [he] was paid, according to the attached  
license  
from Sieur Dumanoir, agent of the Company,  
dated the twenty first of present [year]. The said  
sale and transfer thus [is] made by means of  
the price and sum of fifteen hundred  
livres that the said Brosset promises  


[p. # 2] [dig.3]  


[Marginal note:] (11688)  
  
  
[Body:]  
to pay him in cash upon delivery of the said  
nègre by means of which these proceedings  
will constitute receipt. And another formality,   
as expected, given there is no special claim on the   
said *nègre*, the said *Sieur* Brosset will retain free  
and clear possession without which, for any  
reason,
[possession] can be disturbed,  
as is generally typical [for] whomever is the  
promisee [party]. The said sellers guarantee   
and indemnify against any and all       
by virtue of title, as it has been agreed  
between the parties, thus, the promisee  
obliges and forswears. [It was] done and passed  
at New Orleans in ministerial office in the year  
one thousand seven hundred  
thirty nine, the twenty second of July, in presence  
of the gentlemen François Roumier and François  
Jahan, witnesses residing there [in the city], and   
[before] the said  
Boisson and his wife, declaring not knowing how   
to write nor sign of [which has been] inquired, in  
accordance with the law.



  

[^1]: "In 1728, Jean-Baptiste Labat described the *pièce d’Inde*, the primary measure of commercial exchange on the West African coast as a “measure of potential labor.” The *pièce d’Inde* derived from the *pieza de India*, which entered circulation during the first centuries of slave trading under the Spanish and Portuguese," writes Johnson, *Wicked Flesh: Black Women, Intimacy and Freedom in the Atlantic World* (Penn Press, 2020), 80. "By the eighteenth century, for French traders, a *pièce d’Inde*, according to Labat, was a male slave, between eight and thirty years old, with all of his digits and limbs, as well as 'eyes, ears, teeth,' and was not 'hunchbacked or lame.'"
