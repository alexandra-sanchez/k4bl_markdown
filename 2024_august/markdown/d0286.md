# Summary   
An enslaved man named Pierrot was sold to enslaver Michèl Brosset by Claude Boisson ("*tailladier en cette ville*," tool maker in this city) and his wife, Magdelaine Chenier, who had acquired Pierrot as a *piece d'inde* from the Company of the Indies[^1]. However, Pierrot went missing after having gone maroon. Boisson and Chenier promise to catch Pierrot for Brosset in exchange for cash upon delivery, which they succeed in accomplishing.

[^1]: "In 1728, Jean-Baptiste Labat described the *pièce d’Inde*, the primary measure of commercial exchange on the West African coast as a “measure of potential labor.” The *pièce d’Inde* derived from the *pieza de India*, which entered circulation during the first centuries of slave trading under the Spanish and Portuguese," writes Johnson, *Wicked Flesh: Black Women, Intimacy and Freedom in the Atlantic World* (Penn Press, 2020), 80. "By the eighteenth century, for French traders, a *pièce d’Inde*, according to Labat, was a male slave, between eight and thirty years old, with all of his digits and limbs, as well as 'eyes, ears, teeth,' and was not 'hunchbacked or lame.'"
